HexHunter is a hexcode color guessing game. If you've ever been looking at colors and see something like `#F98B0D` and wondered what that meant this is the game for you!


## Learn
HexHunter helps players understand the basics behind hexcodes. 

## Play
There are several game modes:

- Survival: How long can you last in this hex hunting endurance test? In this timed game, players must accurately guess the color shown to them. As the game progresses, the accuracy requirement increases
- Practice: Hone your hex hunting skills
- Sandbox: Familiarize yourself with the basics of how each digit in the hexcode adjusts the color we see
